<p><strong>SIDNEY POWELL UPDATE</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dear Patriots,</strong></p>

<p><strong>We have three items for you today.</strong></p>

<p><strong>ONE - On April 3, 2021, Sidney had a discussion with Dinesh D’Souza on his podcast.</strong></p>

<p><strong>(By the way, Dinesh is a conservative rock star. His podcast is a “must follow”.)</strong></p>

<p><strong>This is one of the most open and revealing interviews Sidney has given to date about the coup that happened on November 3, 2020.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Under the great questioning by Dinesh, Sidney reveals the massive involvement by the Republican Party to allow the fraud election to be ended instead of pushing for answers. And, she also explained why she is disappointed in President Trump.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Here is the interview:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Here is a link to a story mentioned within the interview so that you can follow up and study the situation even more.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sidney highly recommends that you make yourself aware of this information. There will be more to come from this.</strong></p>

<p><strong>It may seem to be very complicated, and it is, but the more you hear it the clearer it becomes, there was massive, multifaceted fraud in the election.</strong></p>

<p><strong>TWO -&nbsp;Another Sidney interview you may want to listen to is with Ken Matthews.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Here is the link:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://federalappeals.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=1051113c6f6d8825da118b2e3&amp;id=6f5d2b31c3&amp;e=c0acd6157e">https://ihr.fm/3wENVoC</a></p>

<p><strong>THREE - Over the weekend, President Trump called for a boycott of Major League Baseball, Coca-Cola, Delta, and other corporations openly opposing election reforms enacted by the Georgia legislature.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We agree with the President. We urge you to consider withholding your time, attention and money from corporations who are lying about what is in the Georgia bill and blackmailing the state based on this false information. If we do not have fair elections, nothing else matters. <em>These American businesses, that we have all long loved, are supporting legalizing voter fraud.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Special Note to our supporters:</strong></p>

<p><strong>We believe one of the best ways that you can help us in the battle to save America is to educate yourself on the facts and then share that with the people who are in your world.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We will help you by providing information and facts, we ask you to pass along this information through email and all of the social media you participate on.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Information is FREEDOM and POWER!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Always remember, wearing the armor of God, including the Truth, YOU can make a difference every day.&nbsp;</strong> </p>
