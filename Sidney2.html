<p><strong>SIDNEY POWELL UPDATE</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dear Patriots,</strong></p>

<p><strong>We have a lot of news for you today.</strong></p>

<p><strong>First up is an article written by Governor Mike Huckabee.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gov. Huckabee watched the interview with Dinesh D’Souza and Sidney that we sent to you earlier this week and was so moved by it that he penned an article.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You can read the whole thing at the link, we added a brief quote from the Governor here.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Fake News Got it Wrong About Sidney Powell</strong></p>

<p><strong>By MIKE HUCKABEE &nbsp; &nbsp; Published on April 6, 2021 &nbsp; &nbsp;The Stream</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;Powell encourages people to go to her website.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We did, and can save you some searching because we found this update, called “Sidney Powell Responds to the Fake News.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>It lays out in more detail what she was telling D’Souza in their interview. The Dominion case, she says, has no merit because it’s going after her for her legal opinion, an opinion that she claims is based on evidence that she presented to four different courts. As such, her statements are “not subject to challenge under defamation law.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>And she says she did not say that ‘no reasonable person’ would believe her claims.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The page also includes a statement from her attorney, Howard Kleinhendler, which accuses the media of “cutting and pasting” portions of their motion to dismiss the Dominion complaint.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Epoch Times has a story from April 6 about testimony to a Texas state House hearing from the Attorney General’s head of election fraud outlining the HUNDREDS of cases they are pursuing in the state of Texas. Not surprisingly most of these cases involve fraud from mail-in ballots.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Texas is not the only state dealing with massive election fraud cases. It is important to know that fraud is a massive issue for the country, as without fair and clean elections, nothing else matters. Many people are working on this, but no one harder than Sidney Powell.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Election Fraud Prosecution at an ‘All-Time High’: Texas Attorney General’s Office</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;An official in Texas’ Attorney General’s office testified during a state House hearing that the number of election fraud cases in Texas is at an “all-time high.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>The amount is “higher than our historical average by a long shot,” said Jonathan White, the head of the election fraud agency within the Texas Attorney General’s Special Prosecution Division, to the Texas House Elections Committee last week, reported The Texan.</strong></p>

<p><strong>When asked by a state lawmaker if there were trends in election fraud prosecutions, White said that “have 510 offenses pending against 43 defendants in court right now.</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;White said that about 80 percent of those pending cases involve alleged mail-in ballot fraud, and 60 percent of resolved cases involved mail-in voting.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sidney recently did an interview with Rose Tennent and like the interview she did with Dinesh, it is shockingly good.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In this interview she outlined how if the Rule of Law had been followed, Donald Trump would be the President at this moment.</strong></p>

<p><strong>“He was re-elected and should be president right now.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Here is the link to the interview. Please listen and pass it along.</strong></p>
