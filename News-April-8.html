<p>From Jack Posobiec - @JackPosobiec: And this is from 2016!</p>

<p>From Jack Posobiec - @JackPosobiec: MLB&#39;s new All-Star Game location - Denver&#39;s Coors Field - is steeped in its own history of discrimination after the beer company refused to hire black people, Mexican-Americans and women for decades</p>

<p>From David J Harris Jr - @DavidJHarrisJr: DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas says Joe Biden may restart construction on the U.S.-Mexico border to “fill” any “gaps” in the current wall. Isn’t this what would have happened if they didn’t stop the build of the wall in the first place?! </p>

<p>https://rumble.com/vffgbn-listen-to-this.html?mref=7ch9&amp;mc=1xynn</p>

<p>From Standing for Freedom Center - @freedomcenterlu: A traditional monopoly had the ability to control one aspect of the economy, but tech monopolies can control far more elements of American society than a single service or product or supply chain. https://www.standingforfreedom.com/2021/04/06/clarence-thomas-says-the-supreme-court-will-soon-have-no-choice-but-to-take-a-look-at-big-techs-power-over-free-speech/</p>

<p>From Kayleigh McEnany - @kayleighmcenany: It’s been a revealing few days for CBS!</p>

<p>1️⃣ they called for “fight” against GA election law before deleting the tweet</p>

<p>2️⃣ they gave softball Hunter interview, never pressing him on why a laptop w/ thousands of pics of him “might” be his</p>

<p>3️⃣ @60Minutes DeSantis hit job</p>

<p>NOT good!</p>

<p>From Dr. Carol M. Swain - @carolmswain: Have you watched this video where Attorney General Merrick Garland pretends he knows nothing about his own immigration stance or whether he would support enforcement of existing laws? https://youtu.be/7JSmsrIpDJw</p>
