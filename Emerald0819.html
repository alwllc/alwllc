<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Adam Gaertner has provided a fine summary of where we are now in terms of theories about what COVID-19 is really doing to the world:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"This is where this story takes a decidedly dark turn. You may have heard of prions in passing; perhaps in the context of the United Kingdom’s outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, aka mad cow disease, in the ’80s, or as an interesting fact about Papua New Guinean cannibalistic tribes suffering from Kuru, or the genetically inherited Italian disease, fatal familial insomnia. However, this one is going to hit much closer to home."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"The concept of a prion is very simple. Compare it to gray goo, or strange matter; a prion is (generally) a misfolded protein, an incredibly tiny formation of sugars, that converts other proteins to its own misfolded shape[52]. All proteins have some natural function[53]; a pathogenic prion protein ceases being able to fulfil its natural function[54], and in converting other proteins, begins to create aggregations, ...</span></p>
