<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dear Patriots,</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">It is well past time for all of us to stand up and say no.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">There is an abundance of information, from all over the world, that the way the Covid-CCP is being handled is nothing short of stupid.  We all know the definition of stupid.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Again, we find ourselves living under threat of having our lives ripped out from under us with ever growing mandates and edicts by "elected ones" and leftist businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Children are being forced to wear masks for most of their waking hours. Everyone is being forced into masks again, even outside.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">People are being forced to get an unproven, dangerous and now ineffective jab.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">In New York City, American citizens <a href="https://www.fox5ny.com/news/new-york-city-launches-vaccine-passport?utm_source=JangoMail&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=The+Definition+of+Stupid+(343507461)&amp;utm_content="><span class="s4">must produce government approved papers to get food</span></a></span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">In New Zealand, they have <a href="https://m.theepochtimes.com/mkt_breakingnews/new-zealand-thrown-into-national-lockdown-over-single-delta-variant-case_3952366.html?utm_source=JangoMail&amp;%3butm_medium=email2&amp;%3butm_campaign=breaking-2021-08-17-1&amp;%3bmktids=69ff0736fc767430ead819b90dc30ecf&amp;%3best=HLETngT37gQCYfFF2nezpwdtA%2b2wNzzL6Cm1VvakR1hXOhiv2Un%2fBWVYzSERYzRg4e0coUNC&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=The+Definition+of+Stupid+(343507461)&amp;utm_content="><span class="s4">shut down the entire country over one case of Delta variant Covid-CCP.</span></a> Yes, you read that correctly. One case.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">These measures: masks, shutdowns and vaccines are being proven to NOT HAVE WORKED during the past year. In fact, there is more evidence daily that they are making everyone sicker and weaker.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Now, by demanding people get a "booster" vaccine, they are admitting that the jab that 60% of the country has already gotten DOES NOT work.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">These failed tactics are repeated by the "the experts' for reasons we can not understand.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We have the information and the data to wipe out this virus. It will NOT EVER happen with masks, shut downs and vaccines.  Those are simply tactics of fear, control, and destruction of the middle class.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>But, it WOULD happen with the use of safe and inexpensive medicines that are widely available.</b></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Not to mention the safe and non-toxic array of sprays that are ready for use but trapped in the endless web of government approval. These sprays have proven to kill viruses in the air and on surfaces for months at a time. Yes, it is true and I bet you have not even heard of this option.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">It has been totally censored by Big Tech on all platforms. The companies that have invented, tested and produced this new technology have been forced to be silent as they pray the government will approve the use.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Today, we are offering you an array of information and we fervently ask you to watch, listen, and most of all, share with the people in your orbit.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We are as frustrated as you are. We know it is scary to speak out because the consequences are severe. But, more and more people are standing up and eventually, we will be safe in numbers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>1-</b> If all you do today is listen to this earnest nurse lay out ALL the facts, and then share it, that will be a big win. If you post this on social media it will be censored and removed, so share it among your friends and family through email and messaging. Ask them to pass it on.</span></p>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><span class="s1">Get outside and into the sun every day. Do not use sunscreen, but don't stay out until you burn. Just 10-15 minutes of the sun on your skin is the best way to increase Vitamin D in your body.</span></li>
  <li class="li6"><span class="s1">Take your children and grandchildren outside every day to get fresh air and play. Go for walks. Ride bikes. Play in the rain.</span></li>
  <li class="li6"><span class="s1">Take supplements: Vitamin D, Vitamin C and Zinc</span></li>
  <li class="li6"><span class="s1">Eat well, with as much unprocessed food as possible.</span></li>
  <li class="li6"><span class="s1">Get 8 hours of sleep a night.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
